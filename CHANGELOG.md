## [v3.1.0](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-unsafe-reference/releases/tag/v3.1.0) - 2020-10-02

New features:
  - Adds `UnsafeRefEq` and `UnsafeRefEqFallback` newtypes. The first newtype uses unsafe reference equality as an equality check, while the second will try `unsafeRefEq` and fall back to an underlying `Eq` instance. This can provide a significant performance improvement in some situations. Implemented in [#7](https://github.com/purescript-contrib/purescript-unsafe-reference/pull/7) by @LiamGoodacre.
